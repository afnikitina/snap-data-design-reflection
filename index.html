				<h3>What is the most significant thing you have learned about object oriented approach?</h3>
				<p>Object-oriented approach to programming logic and design makes almost any problem a developer needs to solve manageable and easy to visualize. The main idea of solving the problem in object-oriented way is to find objects for your problem and decide how those objects are going to interact with each other in order to make the job done.</p>

				<h3>What is the most significant thing you have learned about the effect of frontend development on the backend development?</h3>
				<p>The frontend developers define the availability of the technologies and techniques that can be used by the backend developers, while setting the limits on those at the same time.</p>

				<h3>Why data encapsulation is so important?</h3>
				<p>Data encapsulation allows the developers to hide important and private data from the outside world. The outside world is only allowed interacting with data needed to be kept safe and secret through public interface (accessors, mutators, and other methods where developers control those interactions and make the rules for interaction and data access).</p>
